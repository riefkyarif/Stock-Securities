# Stock-Securities: Sayur Asem Sekuritas

# Adoption to the C Language

*Background:*
Basically, if we want to invest in stocks in a capital market, we need to choose which stock broker we trust because we can't make transactions directly. In the past, if we wanted to make transactions in the capital market, there were many requirements that needed to be completed, but with advances in technology, current capital market transactions can be done easily. The transaction that we want to do will be carried out by the stock broker. Therefore, we created this program to make it easier for investors to make transactions on the capital market.

*Purpose :*
Make it easy for investors to make stock transactions in the capital market.
Calculating the profit / loss experienced by investors while investing.
